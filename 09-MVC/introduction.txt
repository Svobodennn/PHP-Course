MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a design pattern commonly used in software development,
especially in the context of building web applications. It is used to separate the concerns of an application
into three interconnected components:

    Model: The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for retrieving and storing data,
as well as implementing the rules and calculations that govern the application's behavior. In a database-driven
web application, the Model interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

    View: The View is responsible for the presentation of data to the user. It represents the user interface, displaying
information to the user and handling user input. The View does not contain business logic but is tightly connected
to the Model. It is responsible for rendering data and transmitting user input to the Controller.

    Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View,
processes it, and instructs the Model to perform the necessary actions. The Controller is responsible for managing the
flow of the application, handling user requests, and determining which View should be displayed based on the Model's data.

The MVC design pattern promotes the separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale software
applications. It also allows for reusability of components and helps in achieving a more organized and structured codebase.
MVC is widely used in web development frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, Laravel, and ASP.NET, among others.
